Welcome to my homepage! This is Jiening Li. You can also call me Alison. 

I am a current master's student majoring in computer and information science at UPenn. I graduated from School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh in Scotland, GB. I would also describe myself as an entry-level software developer with a strong curiosity & hands-on experience in fullstack development. My interest also lies on human-computer interaction.

I am actively looking for 2023 summer internship and 2024 new graduate roles in software development. Feel free to drop me a message on Linkedin if you think I am a good fit.

You can find a simple version of my CV in the top bar. For a more detailed profile, please refer to my Linkedin page. 

(Last updated on Feb 8, 2023) This site is under construction. I am still working on figuring out what to put in this personal page, and how to organise them. Thank you for visiting!
