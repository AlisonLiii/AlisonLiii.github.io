1. I lived in Scotland for several years, but it was such a pity that I did not pick up any Scottish accent :(
2. Autumn used to be my favourite season, but now I would definitely pick summer!
3. Mayday is my favourite band. Do check them out on [their YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQyweuVOAh3NHGKDDadRSbg)
